# Intellifire 

Intellifire is a wifi module for a variety of fireplaces. It has both ios/android apps - but they dont like to publish the api.

From my research I've identified 4 endpoints:

`/poll`
`/get_serial`
`/get_challenge`
`/post`

This module will parse data from botht he `/get_serial` and `/poll` endpoints and parse the resultatn JSON into something readable.

If anybody knows more about OAuth and wants to help me reverse engineer the control endpoints I'd love the help!
